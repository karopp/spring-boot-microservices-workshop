# spring-boot-microservices-workshop

The repository is a fork from an oline workshop for spring-boot microservices. The workshop uses Java. I wanted to follow this workshop 
but write the code in Kotlin instead of Java.

We create three microservices, which exchange data via REST.
* Movie-Info-Service: Providing the movie titles
* Ratings-Data-Service: Providing the rating for the movie IDs
* Movie-Catalog-Service: Combining the movie information and the rating to display

## Branch Master

This is the fork from javabrains.io.

## Branch Kotlin-Approach

This is my branch where I convert the code into Kotlin as a programming exercise.
